# Gemini-Chat-Bot
Chat Bot with Gemini Pro Model
This repository contains a simple question and answer chat bot implemented using the Gemini Pro model. The bot is designed to run in VS Code using Streamlit for a user-friendly interface.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

Streamlit
OS
Gemini Pro Model (available through Google's generative AI)
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
Install the required dependencies:
pip install streamlit
# Install other dependencies as needed
Usage
Load the Gemini Pro Model:
from your_gemini_pro_module import GeminiProModel

gemini_model = GeminiProModel()
Start the chat by sending a message:
gemini_model.send_message("Hello, bot!")

Stream all messages for a dynamic chat interface:
# Stream messages using Streamlit
stream_messages(gemini_model)

Record chat history using Streamlit Session State:
# Use Streamlit Session State to record chat history
record_chat_history(gemini_model)

Note: Make sure to replace your_gemini_pro_module with the actual module name you've used for the Gemini Pro model.

API Key
To use the chat bot, obtain your API key for the Gemini Pro model from Google. Replace the placeholder in the code with your own API key. It's important to advise users to use their own API key in their implementations.
# Replace 'your_api_key' with your actual API key
gemini_model = GeminiProModel(api_key='your_api_key')
